# Project Proposal  

Project Proposal: Our project will focus on salaries for athletes in the three major US sports: baseball, basketball, and football. We are using three datasets found using kaggle.com and data.world. The data shows a number of player salaries ranging over many years. More specifically, the baseball data ranges from 1988 - 2016 and the football data ranges from 2014 - 2020. The basketball data shows the top earners for the sport and where they rank on their respective teams as well as leaguewide. The database in which we have chosen to load our final product is SQL (relational database). We chose this database because it gives us a better option to show relationships in the future, if need be. Also, we do not expect the structure of our database to change in the future (given that athlete salaries are straight-forward), so we do not need the flexibility that a non-relational database offers.
